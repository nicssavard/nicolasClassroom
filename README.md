# Nicolas' Classroom

I have made this website while working in a kindergarten in China teaching English. I wanted my students to review their English at home which can be challenging for them when none of their family members speaks English. I also used it during class to play games with the students and grab their attention. They greatly enjoy the website.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
